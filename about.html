                        <p>That's a fun question. I've attended three colleges sice I started college.</p>

                        <p>During my time at community college, I got the chance to study abroad and attend a <i>prestigous</i> university in the UK.
                        <br>That school was called <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/"><b>Canterbury Christ Church University.</b></a></br>
                        <p>The last school, which is the one I currently attend, is <a href="https://missouri.edu/"><b>University of Missouri-Columbia or Mizzou.</b></a></p>
